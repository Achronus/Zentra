# Help

This chapter focuses on steps you can take when encountering errors.

We've designed `Zentra's` error messages to provide you with steps to take for debugging and fixing most problems yourself, but we cannot account for everything.

As a first point of call, we recommend you refer to our [Error Handling Guide](errors.md).

If it's unable to help, we encourage you to follow our [Reporting Issues Guide](report.md).
