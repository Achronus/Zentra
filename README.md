## THIS TOOL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, PLEASE WAIT UNTIL A VERSION RELEASE.

An open-source Python tool that uses [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) models to create [React](https://react.dev/) components. The perfect tool for accelerating [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) frontends with a Python-based backend, such as [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). 

It comes packed with API documentation for building your Python models, and a CLI interface that dynamically creates the frontend files based on the models you've created.

## How It Works

Zentra aims to be a flexible tool that covers a variety of component libraries, while centering around the [NextJS App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs) framework. 

_Note: Some of these items may change during development._

### Structural Elements

It focuses on three structural components: `Pages`, `Blocks`, and `Components`. A page can have multiple blocks, and each block can have multiple components.

When using Zentra, you'll use all three to create the frontend. We'll discuss these in more detail in the future.

### Components

Core component libraries and custom models in development:

- [ ] Zentra Structural Models (1/3)
- [ ] Custom Data Models (0/1)
- [X] Custom HTML Models (4/4)
- [ ] Custom JavaScript Models (1/4)
- [ ] [Shadcn/ui Form](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form) Models (0/13)
- [ ] [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (27/48)
- [ ] [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components) (2/4)
- [X] [Uploadthing](https://docs.uploadthing.com/getting-started/appdir) (1/1)
- [X] [Lucide React Icons](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react) (1/1 - 1 component for all icons)

Future component libraries:
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
- [Tremor](https://www.tremor.so/)
- And more...

## Example Usage

To get a feel for how Zentra works, let's consider the [Shadcn/ui Scroll Area Component](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/scroll-area) as an example. Specifically, the horizontal scrolling example. Here's its JSX:

```jsx
import Image from "next/image"

import { ScrollArea, ScrollBar } from "@/components/ui/scroll-area"

export interface Artwork {
  artist: string
  art: string
}

export const works: Artwork[] = [
  {
    artist: "Ornella Binni",
    art: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1465869185982-5a1a7522cbcb?auto=format&fit=crop&w=300&q=80",
  },
  {
    artist: "Tom Byrom",
    art: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1548516173-3cabfa4607e9?auto=format&fit=crop&w=300&q=80",
  },
  {
    artist: "Vladimir Malyavko",
    art: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494337480532-3725c85fd2ab?auto=format&fit=crop&w=300&q=80",
  },
]

export function ScrollAreaHorizontalDemo() {
  return (
    <ScrollArea className="w-96 whitespace-nowrap rounded-md border">
      <div className="flex w-max space-x-4 p-4">
        {works.map((artwork) => (
          <figure key={artwork.artist} className="shrink-0">
            <div className="overflow-hidden rounded-md">
              <Image
                src={artwork.art}
                alt={`Photo by ${artwork.artist}`}
                className="aspect-[3/4] h-fit w-fit object-cover"
                width={300}
                height={400}
              />
            </div>
            <figcaption className="pt-2 text-xs text-muted-foreground">
              Photo by{" "}
              <span className="font-semibold text-foreground">
                {artwork.artist}
              </span>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        ))}
      </div>
      <ScrollBar orientation="horizontal" />
    </ScrollArea>
  )
}
```

We can divide this into four main parts:
1. The import statements
2. The data `Array[]` and its `TypeScript` props
3. The function wrapper (`export function ScrollAreaHorizontalDemo() { return (...) }`)
4. The component JSX


With Zentra's current functionality, we can recreate `1` and `4` using the following `Python` code:

```python
from zentra.core.html import Figure, FigCaption, Div, HTMLContent
from zentra.core.js import Map
from zentra.nextjs import Image
from zentra.ui.control import ScrollArea

artwork_map = Div(
    styles="flex w-max space-x-4 p-4",
    items=Map(
        obj_name="works",
        param_name="artwork",
        content=Figure(
            key="$artwork.artist",
            styles="shrink-0",
            img_container_styles="overflow-hidden rounded-md",
            img=Image(
                src="$artwork.art",
                alt="Photo by $artwork.artist",
                styles="aspect-[3/4] h-fit w-fit object-cover",
                width=300,
                height=400
            ),
            caption=FigCaption(
                styles="pt-2 text-xs text-muted-foreground",
                text=[
                    'Photo by{" "}',
                    HTMLContent(
                        tag="span",
                        styles="font-semibold text-foreground",
                        text="$artwork.artist"
                    )
                ]
            ),
        ),
    )
)

sa = ScrollArea(
    styles="w-96 whitespace-nowrap rounded-md border",
    content=artwork_map,
    orientation="horizontal",
)
```

In the future, `blocks` will be used for `3` and a custom `Data` model for `2`.

## When Will Zentra Be Officially Released?

We are working hard to release an official version (`v0.1.0`) by the end of `May/June 2024`. This will include the full core functionality listed in the [components](#components) section above, plus a working CLI, and detailed API documentation.

Our goal is to provide a quality open-source product that works 'out-of-the-box' that everyone can experiment with, and then gradually fix unexpected bugs and introduce more component libraries on the road to a `v1.0.0` release.

### On Release

We'll need help from developers like you to make this tool a delight to use, and a product worthy of the `Python`, `NextJS`, `React` and `Software/Web Development` community. 

Feedback and criticism will always be welcomed, and is encouraged to help make this tool worthwhile.

There is still a lot left to do for us to feel comfortable opening Zentra to the world, so stay tuned for more updates if you are interested in using the tool in the future!
